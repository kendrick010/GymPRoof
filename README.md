# GymProof

Discord bot gym (and routine) gamified tracker

## Background

My friend proposed a deal where he must send me pictures/selfies of himself at the gym or completing his daily routines; if he failed to do so, he would lose money. On my stakes, I was responsible for enforcing and reminding him of these rules, and if I didnâ€™t, I would also lose money.

Engineers are very lazy, so I made a Discord bot that automates my bid of the deal while I make passive income lol.

## Discord Bot

Numerous chore commands and a balance system is implemented for participating members.
